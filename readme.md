## Setup of the assignment
The assignment consists of 4 parts:


1. [An introduction to the Scala language](<src/main/scala/intro/readme.md>)
    
    In this part you will get a brief introduction to Scala.
    It teaches you the basics only, you are expected to learn the rest as you go through the assignment.
     
2. [Implement several core FP functions](<src/main/scala/fp_functions/readme.md>)

    With functional programming there are some functions that are used very often.
    In this part you will implement several of these yourself to get a better idea of how they work.

3. [Practice with functional programming](<src/main/scala/fp_practice/readme.md>)

    Now that you know how to program functionally, solve these small exercises in an FP way.

4. [Process a dataset](<src/main/scala/dataset/readme.md>)

    Process a dataset of Github commits using everything you have learned in the previous parts.
